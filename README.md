Learning exercises from:

Build An HTML5 Game 
(by Karl Bunyan)
I hold no copyright; I am learning from this book (educational)


Notes:

Development is currently on a raspberry pi 3, using raspian. 
1. create a webserver. I did a basic LAMP.
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5
- sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client php5-mysql
- sudo service apache2 restart

2. development. I am working in vi, right on the web server.
what this means is, you need to:
   - sudo vi index.html

3. testing. Access via 127.0.0.1/game
- need to determine unit/funtional testing.
